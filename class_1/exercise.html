    <p>
      Sonia Gandhi (n√©e Maino; born 9 December 1946) is an Indian politician. 
      She is the president of the Indian National Congress, a big tent political party, which has governed India for most of its post-independence history.
      She took over as the party leader in 1998, seven years after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, her husband and a former Prime Minister of India, and remained in office until 2017 after serving for twenty-two years.
      She returned to the post in 2019 after her son, Rahul Gandhi, resigned.
